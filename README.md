<h1> Project 2 </h1>

<p> This project is about developing an xkcd style password generator. The password would be a combination of multiple words with numbers, symbols or Uppercase first character. User will be asked to input number of words and whether the password should include symbols and other special characters, numbers and the like. When the user hits the generate password link, the password will be printed on the page.<br>

    I am just coming back from vacation so I started working on this today July 8th. I have created the form UI in index.html. There are 4 fields of input and a link to generate password which I plan to change to a button control.
    Things that remain is the code in logic.php. Here I plan to have an array of words out of which I will randomly pick a number of words based on the user input and present to the user.
