<h1> Project 2 </h1>

<p> This project is about developing an xkcd style password generator. The password would be a combination of multiple words with numbers, symbols or Uppercase first character. User will be asked to input number of words and whether the password should include symbols and other special characters, numbers and the like. When the user hits the generate password link, the password will be printed on the page.

    I am just coming back from vacation so I started working on this today July 8th. I may not be able to finish the complete project but it will have something basic to play with.
